When the world began, there was nothing but Caoxia. A vast, endless swath of sand and rock, windswept though windless, extending in all direction into the darkness. This was the beginning of our world, and from it, as insignificant as it looked, came everything.                         Caoxia lay dormant for millennia, with not so much as a breeze to move a single grain of sand. But Caoxia grew restless, longing for action, movement, anything to provide change and wake it from its slumber. And so, from the spirit of Caoxia, came the gods.                  Hualti and Zazeca, the sisters of ice and fire. Cocala, the spirit of feast, and Loaxi, the avatar of famine. Voxixi, cradler of the forest and his bride Minera, progenitor of minerals. Astra placed the stars above Caoxia, while Nezeca forged the hells below. Ulthia was the strongest of these gods, formed of the largest share of Caoxia?s spirit, and thus she became the queen, with Raxev as her guard. Many more shards of Caoxia?s spirit exist, but the most important of these smaller shards was, in fact, the smallest of them all. Maxi?a was barely even visible while forming from the spirit of Caoxia. And yet, it was Maxi?a who breathed life into clay and made man.
